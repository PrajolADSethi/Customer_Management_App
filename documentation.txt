Part 1 : Basic configuration

1. make repository on github
2. clone on PC (git clone url)
3. cd into the repository (cd name)
4. setup virtual environment [It is a recommended practise as it can help in keeping the required modules and libraries required for the particular project independent].
    command :
    (python -m venv env)
    (env\Scripts\activate)

5.  pip install required setups
6. start project
7. cd into project
8. start app (new command : python manage.py startapp appname)
9. add the app name in the settings


Part 2: views and urls
1. make a url file in the app
2. in the project url we will use the include function and include the app in the path
3. in the views : make the view functions for the required pages which you want
4. in the app url : create paths and in that call the views which you need to route

Part 3 : Template and inheritence
1. created a template folder with a sub app folder inside it containing the html files in it
2. urls already linked to the views  (create dir in the settings file)
3. create vies for template using the render function
4. created html and used template taggings extend in order to extend parent html in child html
   ---then include property for including repetaive codes like navbar in main
   ---{% block content %}{% endblock %}
   ---{% extends/include 'location of html file in the templates folder' %}
