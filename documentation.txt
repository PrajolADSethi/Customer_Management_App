Part 1 : Basic configuration

1. make repository on github
2. clone on PC (git clone url)
3. cd into the repository (cd name)
4. setup virtual environment [It is a recommended practise as it can help in keeping the required modules and libraries required for the particular project independent].
    command :
    (python -m venv env)
    (env\Scripts\activate)

5.  pip install required setups
6. start project
7. cd into project
8. start app (new command : python manage.py startapp appname)
9. add the app name inthe settings


Part 2: views and urls
1. make a url file in the app
2. in the project url we will use the include function and include the app in the path
3. in the views : make the view functions for the required pages which you want
4. in the app url : create paths and in that call the views which you need to route
